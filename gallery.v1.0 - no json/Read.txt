[1] If there is no requested gallery in the URL, a default gallery loads, as you can see in the
    your first access.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2] This script, plugin, site, as you want to call ... automatically identifies the current URLs,
    that is, you can run a full test on localhost and then simply copy to
    an external server, the URLs of the galleries are updated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[3] Does not store images.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[4] QUANTITY OF CHARACTERS ON THE URL: By default the first galleries contain only one character.
    Ex: http://site/gallery/i?=A, the number of characters will increase automatically, gradually
    and more and more slowly, because the name of a gallery must already be in the registry. Ex:
    gallery/i?=A ... gallery/i?=Ad ... gallery/i?=Ad7 .... gallery/i?=7AdsYg5h17k

    INCREASE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS:  Do not want to wait for the number to increase?  =>  view the
    file "gallery/docs/limite.txt", that simple. Enter the number you want.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5] PASSWORD: First access in the gallery you are asked to create a password for area administrative, 
    create one, test login. You will then be prompted to remove the link for your administration table. 
    Even locked with a password, we recommend removing it.
 
    SHA256, it is an encryption without decryption, sometimes it becomes a problem, since it you lose 
    a password like that, fuck it. But, it is itself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[6] REMOVE LINKS from the bottom of the page: go to the "gallery/docs/links/" directory and delete 
    the .txt file corresponding to the menu you want to remove.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[7] Ideal for a brief presentation of images from a media file, movie or screen photos, monetizing
    as you wish. The readable code will help you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[8] This gallery code will be improved and updated soon.
